# Frontend Development in Java

This project demonstrates a basic example of frontend development using Java Swing. While Java is primarily used for backend development, Swing can be utilized to create simple user interfaces for desktop applications.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Compile the `FrontendDevelopmentExample.java` file using the `javac` command.
    
    ```bash
    javac FrontendDevelopmentExample.java
    
    ```
    
3. Run the compiled Java program using the `java` command.
    
    ```bash
    java FrontendDevelopmentExample
    
    ```
    

## Usage

Upon running the application, a JFrame window will appear with a simple welcome message.
